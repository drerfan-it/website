## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#B81104) to convey authority, importance and medical association. This color will be used sparingly, to attract attention to key UI elements and text elements.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F2F2F2), almost white, providing a clean and clinical feel, complementing the deep red and creating high contrast with the text.
- Accent color: Dark Red (#8A0D03), which is a shade of the primary color, adding depth and highlighting interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif providing an elegant and high-end feel for headlines and titles.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif combining modernity with a touch of warmth, used to maximize readability and provide a comforting, approachable feel to the website's text.
- Use of clean, minimalist icons from Font Awesome's medical set to represent services, conditions, and resources, enhancing user understanding and visual appeal.
- Mobile-first, responsive design that ensures readability, ease of navigation, and optimal viewing experience across all devices. The use of grid layouts for sections like 'Conditions Treated' and 'Why Choose Us' maintains a structured, visually appealing format.
